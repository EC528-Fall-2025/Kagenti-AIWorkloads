# EC528-Fall-2025-template-repo

## Vision and Goals
The project aims to expand the capabilities and adoption of Kagenti by defining and implementing new use cases for the platform. This includes extending the core platform to support these new applications, such as integrating agents into enterprise Slack channels.

To facilitate adoption and demonstrate the platform's potential, we will create examples and demos that clearly showcase Kagenti's capabilities. The project will also enhance the Kagenti UI by improving its usability, adding new features, and refining the overall design to create a more intuitive and powerful user experience.

These goals are intended to ensure that Kagenti is a versatile, user-friendly, and effective tool that meets the needs of a wider range of users and use cases.

### 1. Platform Engineers / DevOps Teams
As a platform engineer responsible for bringing AI agent workloads to production, I want an orchestration tool that simplifies deployment, lifecycle management, and secure integration of agents with my existing infrastructure, so that I can reliably scale, enforce security, and connect AI agents to tooling without manual overhead.

**Requirements**:
- Simplified deployment and lifecycle management of agents.
- A standardized operator that integrates agent workloads with infrastructure components like service meshes, gateways, and databases.
- Security enforcement (least privilege, identity propagation) across multi-agent workflows.

For these users, Kagenti needs to provide a standardized deployment and lifecycle manager through patterns such as Kubernetes operators. This will also meet their needs for properly scaled deployments. It will also need security enforcement for AI workloads connected to sensitive tooling while also monitoring traffic between AI agents and tooling effectively.

### 2. Enterprise Application Developers
As a developer building applications powered by AI agents, I want reliable and standardized APIs that abstract away deployment differences across agent frameworks, so that I can integrate agents into enterprise applications without worrying about infrastructure, scaling, or framework inconsistencies.

As an application developer that plans to create AI powered tooling, I want meaningful examples of how agents can be used with Kagenti in a variety of scenarios so that I can understand what value it provides to me and how easily I can deploy applications with the framework. 

**Requirements**:
- Reliable APIs for embedding agents into enterprise apps such as Slack.
- A way to select frameworks fit for a use case without worrying about deployment inconsistencies.
- High availability, scaling, and fault-tolerance.
- Meaningful use case examples to demonstrate how effectively the project solves the developerâ€™s problems.
  
Kagenti needs to standardize agent deployment across agentic frameworks such as LangGraph, CrewAI, or Llama Stack, ensure high-availability services, and provide consistent APIs according to a standard (A2A) in order to reduce integration effort and ease deployment of agent-driven applications.

### 3. Security Engineers
As a security specialist responsible for ensuring compliance of AI-driven workflows, I want continuous authentication and authorization between agents, tools, and human actors, so that I can eliminate static credentials, enforce least-privilege access, and reduce the attack surface of agentic workflows.

**Requirements**:
- Eliminate static credentials and enforce least-privilege access.
- Ensure continuous authentication and authorization for human and machine actors.
- Reduce the attack surface of agentic workflows.
  
Kagenti will need to implement an Agent and Tool authorization system that will continuously authenticate requests between agents and tools to reduce attack surfaces, eliminate credential spoofing to tooling through agents, and give security engineers a better understanding of requests being made with agentic workflows.
